### Terror or Opportunity?

In Clear The Dragons!, you'll face off against fierce beasts like the Great Red Wyrm and the Purple Mancatcher.  Each dragon is a unique threat.  Worse yet, many dragons host human riders, from simple Cavalrymen up to the Dragon Lord.  You and your fellow adventurers will have to be quick-witted to overcome them.
